1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,230
so if you live on planet Earth,

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,370
and you are one of seven billion people
that eats food every day.

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,260
I need you to pay attention,
because over the next three decades.

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,640
We all need to address

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,110
one of the most critical
global challenges of our generation.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,660
and I'm not talking
about climate change.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm talking about food
and agriculture.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,890
in two thousand and fifty,
our global population

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,220
is projected
to reach nine point eight billion,

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,890
with sixty, eight percent of us
living in urban city centers

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,300
in order to feed
this massive population,

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,880
we will need to increase
our agricultural output

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,440
by seventy percent
over current levels.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,780
just to put this number in a perspective,

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,020
we will need to grow more food
in the next thirty,

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,380
five to forty years, then
the previous ten thousand years combined.

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,260
put put, simply not only
as our global population becoming bigger,

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,710
but but it is also getting denser,

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,700
and and we will need to grow
significantly more food

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,760
using significantly less landing resources.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,350
complicating our current efforts
to address these major demographic shifts

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,600
are the challenges facing
the agricultural industry today.

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,880
globally, one third of all the food
that we produce is wasted

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,890
according to one point
six billion tons of food

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,570
that spoiled on the way to the market,

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,780
or expired in a refrigerators,

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,920
or were simply thrown out
by supermarkets and restaurants

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,760
at the end of the day,

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,680
every single year, up to six hundred million people
will get sick eating contaminated food,

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,310
highlighting the challenge
that we have of maintaining global food safety.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
and maybe unsurprisingly,

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,540
the agricultural industry is the single largest
consumer of freshwater,

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,700
accounting for seventy percent
of global usage.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,870
Now you will be relieved to know

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,120
that the agricultural industry
and that the global movement by universities,

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,620
companies and Ngos,

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,350
is putting together comprehensive research
and developing novel technology

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,220
to address all of these issues.

39
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,750
and many have been doing it
for decades.

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,750
but one of the more recent innovations

41
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,440
in food production being deployed
in industrial parks in North America,

42
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,700
in the urban city centers of Asia.

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,050
and even in the arid deserts
of the Middle East is controlled.

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,110
environment, agriculture,
controlled environment.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,690
agriculture is actually just a fancy way of saying

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,960
whether or climate proof farming
and many of these farms

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,650
grow food three dimensionally in vertical racks,

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,890
as opposed to the two dimensions
of conventional farms.

49
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,820
and so this type of food production
is also referred to as indoor vertical farming.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,090
I've been involved in the indoor
vertical farming space

51
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,680
for the past five and a half years.

52
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,310
Developing technology to make
this type of food production

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,440
more efficient and affordable.

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,870
this picture was taken outside of a decommissioned shipping container

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,570
that we converted into an indoor farm

56
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,190
and then launched into the heart
and the heat of Dubai.

57
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,350
indoor vertical farming
is a relatively recent phenomenon.

58
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,900
commercially speaking.

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,090
and the reason for this is

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,070
that consumers care more about food safety

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,230
and where their food comes from,

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,570
and also the necessary technology
to make this possible

63
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,130
is more readily available and lower cost,

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,870
and the overall cost
of food production globally

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,290
is actually increasing,

66
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,770
making this type of food production
more competitive.

67
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,330
so if you want to build
an indoor vertical farm.

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,520
you will need to replace some
of the conventional elements

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,560
of farming with artificial substitutes,
starting with sunlight.

70
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,660
in indoor vertical farms,

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,120
natural sunlight is replaced
with artificial lighting like Leds.

72
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,020
while there are many different
types of Leds being used.

73
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,780
the one that we decided to install here
is called full spectrum Leds,

74
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,780
which was optimized
for the type of vegetables

75
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,150
that we were growing also

76
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,690
also in order to maximize production
for a given space.

77
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,640
indoor vertical farms also utilize

78
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,920
and install racking systems
to grow vegetables vertically.

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,120
and and some of the biggest facilities
stack their production.

80
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,050
fourteen to sixteen
floors high.

81
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,670
now, now now most of these
farms are hydroponic

82
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,850
or aeroplanic systems,

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,620
which means that instead of using soil,

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,290
they use a substitute material
like polyurethane sponges,

85
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,540
biodegradable biodegradable Peat,

86
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,670
mosque and even use
inorganic materials like per light

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,640
and clay pellets.

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,950
another another another unique aspect
about these farms

89
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,570
is that they use
a precise nutrient formula

90
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,620
that is circulated and recycled
throughout the facility.

91
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,410
and and this has pumped
directly to the vegetable's root zone

92
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,330
to promote paint growth and and,

93
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,520
and lastly these farms use a sophisticated
monitoring and automation system

94
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,030
to significantly increase productivity,
efficiency and consistency.

95
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,940
and these tools also provide the added benefit

96
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,090
of producing food that is
more traceable and safe.

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,120
some of the obvious benefits
of growing food in this way

98
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,720
is that you have year round vestibule production.

99
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,820
you have consistent quality
and your predictable output.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,640
some of the other major benefits
include significant resource

101
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,770
use efficiencies.

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,510
particularly water.

103
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,150
for every kilogram of vegetables
grown in this way,

104
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,470
hundreds of leaders of water is conserved
compared to conventional farming methods.

105
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,670
and with the water savings come similar
savings in the use of fertilizer.

106
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,910
one of the highest yielding farms

107
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,090
grows over three hundred

108
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,990
and fifty times more food
per square meter

109
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,320
than a conventional farm.

110
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,260
and weather proofing means

111
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,800
complete control of incoming
contaminants and pests completely eliminated.

112
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,050
the need for the use
of chemical pesticides.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,680
and not to be mistaken, these farms
can produce enormous amounts of food,

114
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,120
with one of the biggest facilities
producing thirty thousand heads

115
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,290
of vegetables a day.

116
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,880
however, as with any new
technology or innovation.

117
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,000
there are some drawbacks,
as you would imagine, growing food

118
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,480
in this way can be incredibly
energy intense.

119
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,790
also, these farms can only produce
a small variety of vegetables commercially,

120
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,160
and the overall cost of the production
still is quite high.

121
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,150
and in order to address these issues,

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,220
some of the biggest and most sophisticated farms
are making significant investments,

123
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,970
starting with energy efficiency.

124
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,010
in order to reduce
the high energy usage.

125
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,310
there are efforts to develop
higher efficiency Leds

126
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,330
to develop lasers optimized
for plant growth.

127
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,260
and using even fiber optic cables

128
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,010
like these to channel sunlight
directly into an indoor vertical farm

129
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,740
during the day to reduce
the need for artificial lighting,

130
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,770
also also to reduce the labor costs
associated with harring,

131
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,780
a more sophisticated, more urban,

132
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,000
and also a more high
skilled labor force.

133
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,380
robotics and automation is used extensively
in large scale facilities.

134
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,690
and you can never really
be too resource efficient.

135
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,380
building indoor vertical farms in

136
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,870
and around urban city centers
can help to shorten the agricultural supply chain

137
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,190
and also help to maintain
the nutritional content in vegetables.

138
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,990
also, there are food deserts
in many countries

139
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,820
that have little to no access
to nutritious vegetables.

140
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,860
and as this industry matures,

141
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,510
it will become possible to provide
more equitable access

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,890
to high quality, highly nutritious festivals

143
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,560
in even the most underprivileged
of communities.

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,040
and finally, and this is really exciting
for me personally.

145
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,130
indoor vertical farming
can actually be integrated seamlessly

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,520
into the citiescape to help
repurpose idle, underutilized

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,910
and unused urban infrastructure.

148
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,190
in fact, this is already
happening today.

149
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,450
ride ride sharing services have taken
hundreds of thousands of cars off the road,

150
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,010
and and they have significantly reduced
the need for parking.

151
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,140
this is a farm that we installed
in central Beijing,

152
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,320
in an underutilized
underground parking structure

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,940
to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels
under utilized infrastructure

154
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,180
is not simply limited to large scale
civil engineering projects.

155
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,330
and they can also include smaller spaces
like idle restaurant corners.

156
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,420
this is an example of a farm

157
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,380
that we installed directly
into the partition of a hotel entrance

158
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,950
in order to grow fresh herbs
and microgreens on site for the chefs.

159
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,070
honestly, if you look around,

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,090
you will find
under utilized space everywhere,

161
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,000
under around an inside
of urban urban developments.

162
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,470
this is a farm that we installed
into an empty office corner

163
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,340
to grow fresh vegetables
for the employees in nearby cafes.

164
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,160
I get to be a part
of all these cool projects,

165
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,230
and and working in the agriculture industry
to improve access and affordability,

166
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,220
to fresh and nutritious produce.

167
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,170
hopefully soon by anyone,
anywhere has been the greatest joy,

168
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,540
and also the most humbling
and intellectually challenging thing

169
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,130
I've ever done.

170
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,680
And now that I've convinced you
that agriculture can be quite sexy.

171
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,460
you will be surprised
and shocked to know

172
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,740
that I still have trouble
fully articulating

173
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,010
how and why I decided to work

174
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,860
or and continue to work
in the agricultural industry.

175
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,760
but a couple years ago,

176
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,710
I found a rather unique answer
hiding in plane slight you see?

177
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,930
I read an article

178
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,920
about how your name particularly your last name
can have a strong influence

179
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,790
on everything from your personality
to your professional career.

180
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,500
this is my Japanese last name.

181
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,560
hold up.

182
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,680
and the characters
translate literally into small farm.

183
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,780
thank you.
